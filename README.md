# DSA-JavaScript
A dive into Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

## Absolute running of an algorith depends on the following factors:
Programming language used to implement the algorithm +
The computer the program runs on+
Other programs running at the same time+
Quality of the operating system+ 

### Time Complexity
Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

### Space Complexity
Amout of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.

### How to represent Complexity
###### Asymptotic notations
These are mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity

1: Big-O Notation   - (Worst case complexity)  => This is the preferred notation.
2: Omega Notation  - Best case complexity
3: Theta Notation  - Average case complexity
